# CustomLinkedList 

# Hi all,
# This is an example of custom linked list from scratch in Java.

# The following are the functionalities:

# 1. Adding items to the linked list. Item can be added in two ways:
     1. By calling the add() which takes an object as an argument and adds it to the list.
      This functions returns a  boolean value.

     2. By calling addAll() which can take multiple arguments in the form of objects and add them all to the list.
      This functions returns a boolean value.


# 2. Removing items from the list. Can also be done in tho ways:
     1. By calling the remove() which takes an a string as a argument and removes the item with matched string.  
        This functions returns a boolean value.

     2. By calling removeAll() which can no argument and simply clears the list. 
        This functions returns a boolean value.

# 3. Search an item from the list. In my case there are two possible ways in which you can search an item:
     1. By name
     2. By friendship age. 
     
     So the search functions cane take either a string argument or an integer argument.
     This functions returns a an object.
