# CustomLinkedList

Hi all,

This is an example of custom linked list from scratch in Java.





The following are the functionality:

1. Adding items to the linked list. Item can be added in two ways:
   1. By calling the add() which takes an object as a parameter and adds it to the list.
      This functions returns a boolean value.
   2. By calling addAll() which can take multiples parameter in the form of an object and adds them all to the list.
      This functions returns a boolean value.
  
2. Removing items from the list. Can also be done in tho ways:
   1. By calling the remove() which takes an a string as a parameter and removes the item with matched string.
      This functions returns a boolean value.
      
   2. By calling removeAll() which can no parameter and simply just clears the list.
      This functions returns a boolean value.
  
3. Search an item from the list. In my case there are two possible ways in which you can search an item:
   1. By name
   2. By friendship age.
   This functions returns a String.
